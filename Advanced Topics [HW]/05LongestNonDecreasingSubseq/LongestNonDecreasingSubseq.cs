//Write a program that reads a sequence of integers and finds 
//in it the longest non-decreasing subsequence. In other words, 
//you should remove a minimal number of numbers from the starting 
//sequence, so that the resulting sequence is non-decreasing. In 
//case of several longest non-decreasing sequences, print the 
//leftmost of them. The input and output should consist of a single 
//line, holding integer numbers separated by a space. Examples:

class LongestNonDecreasingSubseq
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

    }
}
